#####The Schedule

6:30 - 7:00 PM - Mingle, Network and Dinner

7:00 - 7:15 PM - Welcome to WWC & Lightening talk by host

7:15 - 9:00 PM - Choose Your Mobile Coding Adventure

#####Attendees

We welcome any women who are interested in mobile development, need help with a current mobile project, or seek a supportive workspace to learn mobile development.

Beginners pair program with other attendees and can build a simple first app! Mentors are available to answer any and all questions.

Advanced attendees can come with specific questions, or an app in mind. Mentors can suggest tutorials to address the areas an attendee should learn to build their app idea, or help out with teaching and mentoring.

#####Prep Work for Attendees

If they do not have the proper equipment, don't worry. They can pair up to work together.
