###Welcome to the MobileStudyGroup!

---

This is the Github repo for the Women Who Code Mobile Study Group.

If you are a WWC Organizer looking to run a Women Who Code Mobile Study Group like we do in San Francisco, take a look at the [logistics page](logistics.md) as well as our pages on resources.

If you are interested in mobile development, need help with a current project, or seek a supportive community in San Francisco, you can attend our technical workshops. We meet every other Monday at workspaces provided by the amazing tech companies who host us. Our workshops are open to women developers of all levels, from complete beginners to seasoned professionals.

Beginners can pair program with other attendees and build an app! No matter what your level, you can move at your own pace and get your hands dirty working on projects from initial design through full implementation. We invite participants to work on whatever they like. Mentors will be floating around to answer any and all questions.

[RSVP via Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/find/events/?allMeetups=false&keywords=women+who+code+SF+mobile) to attend an upcoming workshop.

**_IMPORTANT_**: If you are a beginner and attending for the first time, you will need to install some software on your laptop. (If you cannot bring a laptop, don't worry. We can pair you up with another attendee.) The installation process can sometimes involve an hour or more of waiting while files download. Do this well in advance of your first workshop.
